So, you want to do the swap? Great! Here's your options

* Have someone do it for you
    * I'd be more than happy to program it for you! 
        * Contact us at {%- include ig.html -%} <br>
        * By having me program your cluster, you're supporting these docs. 
    * Find someone local
* Want to do it yourself?
    * That's cool too! That's why these docs are here.
    * If your car is immo deleted:
        * This will be the easiest option. On your new cluster, follow the instructions for Making a cluster virgin on [this page](/cluster-docs/service-mode-all-keys-lost/)
        * __Make sure to backup your ABS coding, since the cluster's VIN will change__
            * More info at [Removing your cluster](/cluster-docs/removing-your-cluster)
    * If your car is a 2006 or earlier:
        * Sorry, For now, I don't have any docs on these clusters. Search around VW forums for any posts involving "VAG K CAN" That should work for you.
    * If your car is a 2007 - 2015, and i want to keep my immobilizer intact:
        * Awesome! This guide is perfect for you
